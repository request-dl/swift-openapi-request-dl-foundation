# OpenAPIRequestDL

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in alpha stage and subject to change as it evolves.

The `RequestDLClientTransport` enables the use of the `OpenAPI` format along with all the available configuration properties provided by `RequestDL`.

To generate code for the objects, you should use the [Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator).

Additionally, Apple has provided all the details in the WWDC23 session [Meet Swift OpenAPI Generator](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10171).

- MINOR version: Increments when new features or enhancements are added in a backward-compatible manner. It may include improvements, additions, or modifications to existing functionality.

- The PATCH version includes bug fixes, patches, and safe modifications that address issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities without disrupting existing functionality. It may also include new features, but they must be implemented carefully to avoid breaking changes or compatibility issues.

It is recommended to review the release notes for each version to understand the specific changes and updates made in that particular release.
